    """Pseudo Amplifier for Brain Products MR-compatible systems.
    These systems are actually quite quite old, but still somenow the go-to
    for anything related to MR-EEG.


    This amplifier connects to ... well, connecting to maybe is too 'active'.
    It really rather tries to listen to the (directed) network traffic generated
    by the RDA option in the Recorder software. Incidentally, this is the
    exact same method of operation employed by RecView. Which is it's time
    way ahead.

    There should be an ipyNB explaining exactly how to use mushu in combination
    with the Recorder.
    This implementation is ESSENTIAL to allow my work to combine
    BP systems with the mushu - wyrm - pyff way of doing EEG-NF things in
    Python Jupyter Notebooks. Which I think is THE way of handling any NF
    experiment since it'd give experimenter total control, keep things
    simple, and force them to be more closer to the computer and coding practices.
